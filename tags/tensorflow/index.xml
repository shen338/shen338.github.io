      <description>KL divergence and JS divergence Before diving into details, let first review two very important metrics to quantify the similarity of two probability distributions: Kullback-Leibler Divergence and Jensen-Shannon Divergence.
 Kullback-Leibler Divergence measures the divergence of probability distribution p(x) to q(x): $$KL(P||Q) = \int_x P(x)log\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}dx$$ KL(P||Q) achieves its minimum zero when P(x) and Q(x) are the same everywhere.
KL divergence is widely used as a metrics to measure the similarity between two distributions.</description>

      <description>Table of contents/optimization  Interpretation and Advantage of Batch Norm Algorithm and implementation Improvements and Alternatives  Batch norm fused with Convolution Layer normalization Instance Normalization Group Normalization Other normalization techniques*  Reference Materials:  This article will thoroughly explain batch normalization in a simple way. I wrote this article after getting failed an interview because of detailed batchnorm related question. I will start with why we need it, how it works, then how to fuse it into conv layer, and finally how to implement it in tensorflow.</description>
