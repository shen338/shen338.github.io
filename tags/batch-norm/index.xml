      <description>Table of contents/optimization  Interpretation and Advantage of Batch Norm Algorithm and implementation Improvements and Alternatives  Batch norm fused with Convolution Layer normalization Instance Normalization Group Normalization Other normalization techniques*  Reference Materials:  This article will thoroughly explain batch normalization in a simple way. I wrote this article after getting failed an interview because of detailed batchnorm related question. I will start with why we need it, how it works, then how to fuse it into conv layer, and finally how to implement it in tensorflow.</description>
