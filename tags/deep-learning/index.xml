      <description>This article will thoroughly explain batch normalization in a simple way. I wrote this article after getting failed an interview because of detailed batchnorm related question. I will start with why we need it, how it works, then how to fuse it into conv layer, and finally how to implement it in tensorflow.
Here is the original paper about batch normalization on Arxiv:
Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents  Data preparation Super Resolution ResNet Generative Adversarial Network Model  Nowadays, a lot of images on the Internet are intentionally blurred or mosaiced due to various reasons. The main objective of this project is to reconstruct these images, especially heavily blurred ones, to their original high-resolution counterpart. This problem is an ill-posed problems, we need to predict fine-grained details only based on little information on degenerated images.</description>
